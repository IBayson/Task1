# Task 1: Code Management System


## Git and Source Code Management

[Git](http://git-scm.com/) is a popular source code management system.
Every Git working directory is a full-fledged repository, with complete history and version tracking capabilities, not dependent on network access or a central server.
Git is developed primarily on Linux, although it supports most major operating systems including BSD, OS X, and Microsoft Windows.
Information about Git can be found on the project website.

http://git-scm.com/


### Action Items

* __Peruse__: [Git documentation](http://git-scm.com/doc/) (optional).
* __Try__: [Git tutorials](http://try.github.io/).
* __Download and Install__: [Git software](http://git-scm.com/downloads) (if needed).


## GitHub

[GitHub](https://github.com/) is a web-based hosting service for source code management (SCM).
It is built on the Git revision control system and offers free accounts for open source and educational projects.
We will employ a Git archive for programming challenges throughout the semester.
The organization for this course is hosted on GitHub.

Active participants are given write access to assignments.
A short list of frequently used commands appears below.


### Common Actions

* __Init__:
The `init` command creates a new local repository.
* __Clone__:
Use `clone` to instantiate a working copy from a master repository.
This is usually the first command employed to establish a local working hierarchy under this paradigm.
* __Add__:
The `add` command is used to add one or more files to staging.
Only add pertinent files to the repository.
* __Commit__:
The `commit` command incorporates changes to your working copy of the repository.
* __Push__:
The `push` command sends changes to the master branch, typically a remote repository.
* __Pull__:
The `pull` command fetches and merges changes on the remote server to the local working directory.
* __Mergetool__:
Sometimes, there may be a discrepancy between the latest version of a file and its working copy on a given host.
In such cases, the developer may need to take action to resolve these issues.
This can be achieved through normal editing, followed by the Git `add` command.
Alternatively, one can use the  `mergetool` command, which initiates a visual tool.
* __Status__:
The `status` command lists the status of working files and directories.


### Action Items

* __Account__: Go to [GitHub](https://github.com) and create a developer account (if needed).
Complete the GitHub fields `Name`, `Public email`, and upload a picture.
* __Complete__: The [Python](https://www.python.org) exercise described in `StudentID.ipynb`.


## GitHub Student Developer Pack

[GitHub](https://github.com/) also created the [Student Developer Pack](https://education.github.com/pack) to give students free access to developer tools in one place and thereby support education.
You may want to get your pack.
